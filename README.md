❑Traditional waste collection is manual & 
inefficient
❑Issues: overflowing bins, unhygienic 
conditions, fuel wastage
❑No real-time monitoring or alerts
❑Our solution: IoT-based smart system

Components
with sensors, GPS, and cloud dashboard
❑Bin fill-level monitoring (ultrasonic sensors)
❑Temperature monitoring for safety
❑Truck GPS location tracking (live)
❑Dashboard & mobile app for real-time status
❑Smart alerts for full bins
❑Collection scheduling & route optimization
Hardware:
• Ultrasonic sensor (bin level)
• Temperature sensor (DHT11)
• GPS module (bin & truck tracking)
• ESP32 / Microcontroller
• MPU6050
• HX711 with load cells
Software:
• Arduino IDE (programming)
• Cloud database (Firebase)
• Hivemq mqtt broker
• Web dashboard with analytics


Circuit Design
•Ultrasonic Sensor – Measures bin fill level.
•DHT11 Sensor – Monitors temperature and humidity inside 
the bin.
•HX711 with Load Cells – Detects the weight of the waste.
•MPU6050 – Monitors bin orientation/motion for stability.
•Neo 6M GPS Module – Tracks bin location in real-time.
•Truck GPS Tracker (ESP32 + Neo 6M) – Tracks garbage truck 
location.
•ESP32 Controller – Collects sensor data, processes it, and 
sends it to the cloud for dashboard/app monitoring.

Conclusion
❑Automated and efficient waste monitoring
❑Real-time alerts reduce overflowing bins
❑GPS improves transparency and scheduling
❑Saves time, fuel, and cost
❑Promotes cleaner and smarter cities
